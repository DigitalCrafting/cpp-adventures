# C++ Quickstart

This directory contains code from [Quick Start to Modern C++ for Programmers](https://www.udemy.com/course/quick-start-to-modern-c-for-programmers/learn/lecture/34881300?start=0#overview) course on Udemy.

This one will be just one directory with some files, each with it's own `main()` function, each touching on some subject of C++ code, since making new directory for each section as in Make and CMake ones would be waste of time.
