# [Textures](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures)

Each vertex of the triangle has to be associated with a coordinate in the texture. 
Texture coordinates start from (0,0) in the bottom-left, to (1,1) in upper right:

(0,1)------------------(1,1)
|                          |
|                          |
|                          |
|                          |
|                          |
|                          |
(0,0)------------------(1,0)
